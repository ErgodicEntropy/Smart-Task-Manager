# Risk-Neutral Task Manager

A task management framework designed to optimize productivity by aligning tasks with energy levels, avoiding **Learned Helplessness**, and building **Failure Tolerance**. This system starts by focusing on small, easy-to-complete tasks to accumulate early successes, gradually increasing the complexity of tasks while leveraging the psychological principle of **Sunk Gain** to improve resilience and task performance.

## Features

- **Energy-Task Alignment**: Prioritize tasks based on available energy and optimal difficulty.
- **Failure Tolerance**: Build resilience by starting with easier tasks and progressively handling more complex ones.
- **Avoid Learned Helplessness**: Leverage initial successes to avoid frustration and increase motivation.
- **Sunk Gain Exploitation**: Use small, early wins to create momentum and buffer against failures.
- **Risk-Neutral Decision Making**: Focus on guaranteed gains to exploit risk-aversion toward losses.

## How It Works

The system starts by estimating the energy required for a list of tasks and selects the optimal one based on your current energy level. By focusing on tasks that provide early rewards, it helps build a psychological buffer, reducing the impact of future failures and encouraging consistent progress. This approach applies **Martin Seligmanâ€™s theory on Learned Helplessness**, aiming to unlearn helplessness through effort and strategic task selection.
